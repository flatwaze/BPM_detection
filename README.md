# BPM_detection
This project involves building a model to predict a song's BPM (beats per minute). The training data is a CSV file containing precomputed metrics describing various musical characteristics. The goal is not only to generate predictions for a separate test.csv dataset, but also to compare classical ML models with modern Neural Networks.
